# Below are the default parameters that can be changed by uncommenting
# and passing this file to iss_sort during the histogramming stage.
#
# This file is not required to run iss_sort, but if you want meaningfull
# physics histograms at the end, then you should change the parameters
# here to match your experiment. One can have multiple versions of this
# file to sort different runs or apply different recoil gates, etc.


## Reaction definition
#BeamA: 30.		# this is actually the mass in u, not mass number (one day iss_sort will have mass tables)
#BeamZ: 12		# yes, it is Z, the atomic number 
#BeamE: 8500.		# the laboratory beam energy in keV/u (note, not the usual MeV/u)
#TargetA: 2.		# same for target
#TargetZ: 1		#  
#EjectileA: 1.		# in (d,p) the ejectile is the proton
#EjectileZ: 1		#  
#RecoilA: 31.		# the recoil is the heavy ion
#RecoilZ: 12		# 


## Magnetic field settings
#Mfield: 2.0		# Magnetic field strength in Tesla 


## Recoil cut files
#NumberOfRecoilCuts: 4	# this should be equal to the number of sectors of the recoil detector for now
#RecoilCut_0.File: NULL	# ROOT file containing the 2D recoil energy cut for sector 0
#RecoilCut_0.Name: CUTG	# name of the TCutG object inside the ROOT file for sector 0
#RecoilCut_1.File: NULL	# sector 1
#RecoilCut_1.Name: CUTG	# sector 1
#RecoilCut_2.File: NULL	# sector 2
#RecoilCut_2.Name: CUTG	# sector 2
#RecoilCut_3.File: NULL	# sector 3
#RecoilCut_3.Name: CUTG	# sector 3
